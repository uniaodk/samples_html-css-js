# Responsive 

Has many CSS framework that use layout, grid and flexbox. This examples I used the [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/). Some features can't work in some specific browsers, then you search on [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/)

## Sample 1

- Mobile first on style
- `@media` can be screen or print

## Sample 2

- Grid System Bootstrap [Compiled CSS and JS](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- .min is more efficient (less lines)

## Sample 3

- Flex box Bootstrap [Tricks Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- Use `display: flex`
- Config direction `flex-direction`. Options: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse`
